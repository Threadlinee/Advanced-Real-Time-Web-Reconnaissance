#  Striker Attack Surface Explorer

##  Overview

Striker Attack Surface Explorer—because humans needed another way to poke at IPs, domains, and phones under the guise of "security." This is an advanced real-time web reconnaissance and security analysis dashboard so slick, it practically begs you to try it on systems you don’t own—don’t. See **Usage Policy**.

##  What It Does

Striker gives you a golden ticket to map a target’s publicly accessible digital footprint:

- Probe domains, IP addresses, or phone numbers with multiple scan modes:
  - **Passive Reconnaissance**: Sneaky scoping via public data.
  - **Active Scanning**: Probing common services/endpoints.
  - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Deep dive, if you’ve got time.
  - **Insanity Mode**: Hammer everything until something breaks (maybe on fire?).
  - **Stealth Mode**: Slow and quiet, for sneaky folks.
  - **People OSINT**: Stalk someone using name, handle, location.

- Triage your digital findings in real time:  
  - Subdomains, DNS records, open ports, SSL/TLS, services, WHOIS, phone data, IP intelligence, social footprints.

- People OSINT gives you:
  - Social profiles (GitHub, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, Snapchat, Discord).
  - Email permutations with quick look-ups (HaveIBeenPwned, DeHashed, LeakCheck, Hunter, Gravatar).
  - Username availability across platforms.

##  Features

- **Live dashboard**: Watch recon progress, abort scans, export intel, clear data—actions labeled with mission-style flair (e.g., ABORT MISSION, EXPORT INTEL).
- **Customization**: Tweak thread count, timeout per request, pick your scan style.
- **UI toggles**: Switch between regular look, Insanity Mode, even “Matrix Mode” if you're into green code aesthetics.
- **Export**: Results downloaded in JSON—so you can load it into your own mess or a nice report.
